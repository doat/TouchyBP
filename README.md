2. Browse to `index.html` from your desktop and mobile.
3. Edit the file to your liking and make it your own.

If you got a server that runs php, start with `index.php` so you could enjoy [TouchyPHP](https://github.com/doat/TouchyPHP) which enables embedding assets into the page (potentially speeding up load time).
